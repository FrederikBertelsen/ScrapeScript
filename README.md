# ScrapeScript
A DSL for web scrapping


## TODO
1. Import data to execute from
   1. figure out syntax
   2. write code
2. implement BeautifulSoup4 (tab navigation simulation)
3. custom css: ":parent", ":text_contains()", etc.?
4. pipes (connecting ScrapeScripts together)?
   1. can we do realtime data feedthrough?
   2. figure out syntax for piping data between ScrapeScripts
   3. Can we maybe have muliple ScrapeScripts in the same file, with some pipe connecters somehow?
   4. paralellism?
   5. What would be the best way to implement this?
5. More steps?
