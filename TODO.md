## Current TODO
1. Import data to execute from
   1. figure out syntax
   2. write code
2. implement BeautifulSoup4 (tab navigation simulation)
3. custom css: ":parent", ":text_contains()", etc.?
4. pipes (connecting ScrapeScripts together)?
   1. can we do realtime data feedthrough?
   2. figure out syntax for piping data between ScrapeScripts
   3. Can we maybe have muliple ScrapeScripts in the same file, with some pipe connecters somehow?
   4. paralellism?
   5. What would be the best way to implement this?
5. More steps?
   1. save current url to field step
   2. save time to field step
   3. extract html of selector?
   4. download image
6. fix bugs
   1. parser doesn't pass css selectors with ":nth-child(1)" in it. no : or num chars
   2. string does not parse numbers.
   3. string should not parse new-lines!
